# Meme Design

One day someone send me this meme and I thought "this is not stupid, this is amazing, useless, but amazing:

<img src="./readme-imgs/photo_2022-06-03_11-19-55.jpg" alt="original meme" height="620">

So I created this repository so anyone can have a place to express themselves creatively, reproduce the worst designs they ever seen or waste some time to laughing and learning what not to do when designing user experience.

Feel free to contribute, specially if you are initiating your career as a web developer!

Soon there will be more instructions on how to setup the project locally and make pull request of your code.
